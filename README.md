# EYE-BALL-CURSOR-MOVEMENT-CONTROLLING-USING-OPENCV-IN-PYTHON

This HCI (Human-Computer Interaction) application in Python(3.6) will allow you to control your mouse cursor with your facial movements, works with just your regular webcam. Its hands-free, no wearable hardware or sensors needed.

At this point, you are forced to work with the facial movements I chose but I am working on making them configurable. The list of actions include:

Squinting your eyes (squint - To look with the eyes partly closed, as in bright sunlight)
Winking
Moving your head around (pitch and yaw)
Opening your mouth (a little bit, yes)
Special thanks to Adrian Rosebrock for his amazing blog posts [2] [3], code snippets and his imutils library [7] that played an important role in making this idea of mine a reality.
